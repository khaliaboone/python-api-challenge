# python-api-challenge
While building my codes for the weatherpy and vacationpy, I was able to assess which vairiables and strings to use. I started off with importing my data and inserts pandas and matplotlib so that I read the files in my code. I was able to get my code established with help from "ChatGPT". I learned what each line in the code represented and why it was carried out in the manner in which it typed. While redoing the code with help I was able to get it run sucessfully this time, as this is my second time submitting this assignement. I aquired help from "ChatGPT" and "Xpert Learning" but both to no avail. I was not able to get my charts plotted and my map to be established correctly. Please on where you think I could've improved on. I really want to get this right and have no problem trying again.
